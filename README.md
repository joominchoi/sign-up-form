## Thoughts


## Learnings
- How to use flex to determine how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container
- Include slight margin at the bottom to make box shadow appear at bottom which is being cut off


## Recapping
- Set the flex-direction to column and then set justify-content to space-between in order to push content to the ends of column cleanly (to push content to the top and bottom of page): Used to push credit-text to bottom of page without using absolute positioning
